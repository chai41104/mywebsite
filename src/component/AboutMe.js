      I am a Software Engineer with a strong programming background and experience. For many years, I have been developing strong programming skills, algorithms, data structures and machine learning techniques. I also implemented many projects in C/C++, JavaScript, Java, Python and other computer languages. With innovative ideas, these projects have disrupted the traditional solutions and reduced a significant cost such as a visited museum app. On my free time, I also attend many online courses and many programming competitions such as Hacker Rank and Hackathon. In Hackathon, I have an excellent chance to discuss and learn with many experts in many technology areas as same as sharing many innovative ideas to change humanâ€™s life. In the meantime, I developed various useful skills such as fast-learning, problem-solving and adaptive skill. As a result, I have received many winner prizes in many hackathons such as InsurTech Hackathon (AI & Robotics) and London Innovation Hackathon by Barrick in 2017.
